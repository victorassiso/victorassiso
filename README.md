## Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently a front-end developer at the [Data Office of the Rio de Janeiro City Hall](https://www.dados.rio/), where I craft modern, user-centric web applications that make a real impact.

💼 **What I’m working on:**\
Collaborating with municipal departments like Health, Women's Affairs, and the Civil House Secretariat to deliver feature-rich platforms. My projects include:

- 🗺️ Interactive, feature-rich maps.
- 📄 Automated PDF report generation.
- 📊 Dynamic Dashboards, Timelines, Tables and more.

🚀 **My Tech Stack:**\
Specializing in [React 19](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/), with tools like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) for building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications.

🌟 I’m passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.
